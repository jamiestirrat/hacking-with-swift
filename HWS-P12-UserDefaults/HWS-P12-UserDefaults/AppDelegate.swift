 What we did: P10
 
 1. Setup file as standard
 2. Deleted VC and replaced with CollectionView (assign class, initial view controller, cell size)
 3. Setup Cell (UI Image, Label, Constraints, Reuse Identifier) * - can also do programmatically
 5. PersonCell Class containing outlet for name and image* - defining the cell but we do this later in the cell for item method
 6. Connected cell outlets with storyboard *
 7. Program View Controller - numberOfItemsInSection, cellForItemAt *
 8. Added add button to navigation bar
 9. Method to present image picker on pressing on button on nav bar
 10. Added Picker and Nav Delegates to ViewController inheritance (Nav allows cancel or selection with picker)
 11. Added privacy alert in plist - access photos
 12. Picker controller methods 1. to return selected data 2. to store that data
 13. Create an array of people with a Person 'class' - remember it needs init() *
 14. Code for creating and appending new person added to Picker method *
 15. Change collectionView method, NumberOfItemsInSection to equal the count of people
 16. Show the correct information in each cell, cellForItemAt (also format the cell to our liking)  *
 17. Name Change method using UIAlert added to new collectionView method (didSelectItemAt)
 
 
 Why we use a class for Person instead of a struct (which automatically has init()) in P12
 
 We need to use a class as structs will not inherit the NSCoding protocol - NSCoding requires you to work with objects.
 
 What we did: P12
 
 UserDefaults - a programmatic interface for interacting with defaults system. The default system allows the app to be customised to match a users preference. referred to as defaults as they are loaded as default state when the app is launched
 
 1. Inherited the NSCoding protocol in Person
 2. Added code for init (decoding) and encode() in Person
 3. Added code to ViewController to load and save
    - save() method created & added to didSelectItemAt method
    - load array back from disk in ViewDidLoad()
